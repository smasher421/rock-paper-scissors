# rock-paper-scissors
This is the first JavaScript project available on https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors .  I will try to add an improve this project with a GUI later


This project has currently been completed under its current chapter in the "Foundations" page of Odin. 
Function for comparing between player choice and computer choice was added.
Function for playing 5 rounds of the game depending on player input have been added.
Function for the computer choice depending on 3 strings chosen at random have been added.
Cleaned up code and added comments wherever was needed.
Player prompt and function calling improved.
The game is now functional depending on the player prompt in the console.

I took liberties with this project. Added "Alert" messages instead of console.log() results as they are easier to read and wanted to test the functionality of returning alerts and prompts.

Project will be updated once a GUI has been added (I'm guessing this comes at a later stage of the Odin Project).
