# rock-paper-scissors
This is the first JavaScript project available on https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors .  I will try to add an improve this project with a GUI later


Plans for this project currently: 

Repo on GitHub: --> STARTED. CLONED

Blank document --> STARTED

getComputerChoice --> I need this function to randomly return rock, paper or scissors to make this computer play. I gotta use the browser console to make sure the expected output is returned

I need a function that plays a single round of "Rock, Paper, Scissors". 

I need 2 parameters: playerSelection and computerSelection --> A string will be returned that declares the winner of the round with "You Lose! Paper beats Rock" (playerSelection needs to be case-insensitive)
